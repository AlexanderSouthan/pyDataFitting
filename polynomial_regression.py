    Do a regression with a piecewise polynomial fit on the segmentation points.

    This method is useful if the segmentation points for a piecewise polynomial
    fit are not exactly known, but can be guessed to some extent. Generally, it
    is possible to give the whole data range as boundaries, so effectively no
    boundary conditions are passed to the fit, however this is not recommended
    and may result in an error message. It is better to provide separated
    boundaries for the segmentation points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_values : ndarray
        A 1D array with the length M holding the independent varibale used for
        the fit.
    y_values : ndarray
        A 1D array with the length M holding the dependent varibale used for
        the fit.
    poly_orders : list of int
        A list containing the polynomial orders used for the fit. Must contain
        one more element than border_bounds.
    border_bounds : list of tuples
        The range the fit varies the x values of the segmentation points. Each
        tuple has two entries and defines the range for one segmentation point,
        so the list has as many tuples as segmentation points are present. The
        first value in the tuple is the lower boundary, the second the upper
        boundary for the respective segmentation point.
    y_bounds : None, or list of tuples or None, optional
        The range the fit varies the y values of the segmentation points. Each
        tuple has two entries and defines the range for one segmentation point,
        so the list has as many tuples or None as segmentation points are
        present. The first value in the tuple is the lower boundary, the second
        the upper boundary for the respective segmentation point. Default is
        None which means no point constraint at the segmentation point.
    slope_bounds : None, or list of tuples or None, optional
        The range the fit varies the slope values at the segmentation points.
        Each tuple has two entries and defines the range for one segmentation
        point, so the list has as many tuples or None as segmentation points
        are present. The first value in the tuple is the lower boundary, the
        second the upper boundary for the respective segmentation point.
        Default is None which means no point constraint at the segmentation
        point.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum numer of iterations performed in the iterative fit
        algorithm (currently differential evolution). The default is 1000.

    Returns
    -------
    y_fit : ndarray
        A 1D array containing the y values of the fit at the x values given in
        x_values.
    coefs : list of ndarray
        A list containing the coefficient vectors of the polynomial equations
        for the data segments. Each list entry can be passed directly to
        np.polynomial.polynomial.polyval to calculate the polynomial values.
    evo_fit : scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult
        The result of the differential evolution fit.

    Piecewise polynomial fit using polynomial_fit for the data segments.

    Since polynomial_fit allows constraints such as fixed points or fixed
    slopes, this can be used for the piecewise polynomial fit as well. By
    default, the data is divided into segments at the values given in
    segment_borders and the segments are fitted each by a polynomial fit using
    the least squares method. Thus, discontinuities will arise at the segment
    borders between the fits of the segments. These discontinuities can be
    suppressed by applying equality constraints to the fits that force the fit
    curves through specific points or to have specific slopes. The method
    allows to use polynomials of different orders for the different segments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_values : ndarray
        A 1D array with the length M holding the independent varibale used for
        the fit.
    y_values : ndarray
        A 1D array with the length M holding the dependent varibale used for
        the fit.
    segment_borders : list of int or float
        The values with respect to x_values at which the data is divided into
        segments. An arbitrary number of segment borders may be given, but it
        is recommended to provide a sorted list in order to avoid confusion.
        If the list is not sorted, it will be sorted and the sorting is also
        applied to y_at_borders and slope_at_borders (if they are given), but
        not to poly_orders.
    poly_orders : list of int
        A list containing the polynomial orders used for the fit. Must contain
        one more element than segment_borders.
    y_at_borders : None, or list of float or None, optional
        May contain dependent variable values used as equality constraints at
        the segment borders. The fits of both touching segments are forced
        through the point given by the pair (segment border, y_at_border). The
        list entries may also be None to state that at a certain segment
        border, no constraint is to be applied. The default is None which means
        that no contraints are applied for any segment border.
    slope_at_borders : None, or list of float or None, optional
        Analogous to y_at_borders, with the difference that here, fixed slopes
        at the segment borders are given. The default is None.

    Fit a dataset with a polynomial function including constraints.

    The fit uses Lagrange multiplicators to introduce equality
    constraints after formulating the polynomial fit as a
    multilinear fit problem. The least squares of the residuals
    is minimized upon the fit. The fit polynomial is described by
    the following expression:

        y_f = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + a3*x^3 + ... + an*x^n
            = [1   x   x^2   x^3  ...  x^n]*[ a0 ]

    The minimization problem of the unconstrained fit is:
        d(X*a-y)^2 = 0
    with X as a matrix containing as many rows as data points to be
    fitted, given by the vector y:
        X = [1   x   x^2   x^3  ...  x^n]
            [1   x   x^2   x^3  ...  x^n]

            [1   x   x^2   x^3  ...  x^n]
    The set of linear equations to be solved for a is then given by:
        X(T)*X*a = X(T)*y
    with (T) meaning the transposed matrix.

    Constraints are introduced by:
        y_c = C*a
    with y_c as a vector of y values and C as the matrix to
    calculate y_c with a. The Lagrangian with Lagrange
    multiplicators lambda is constructed and its minimum is found
    by:
        [2*X(T)*X   C(T)] * [  a   ] = [2*X(T)*y]
        [  C          0 ]   [lambda]   [   b    ]

    fixed_points : list of tuples or None, optional
        Contains constraints for points that the fit functions must

        constraints are to be applied, this must be None. The
        default is None.
